// 14th_ua's MoE Calculator -- the SHARED transient machinery behind both centre-screen in-battle
// bars (MoEProgress.js = Moving Average, MoEEfficiency.js = Damage Efficiency). Everything in here
// was byte-identical in the two files; only the values each bar animates were ever different.
//
// The two bars are radio ALTERNATIVES -- Python opens exactly one -- but they are SEPARATE Gameface
// DOCUMENTS, so this module is instantiated twice with no cross-talk: every piece of state below is
// a closure local of createTransient(), never a module-level variable. (Both documents already
// import ../../libs/model.js, so module resolution across this directory is proven.)
//
// EVERY BEHAVIOUR HERE COST A CLIENT RELAUNCH TO FIND. Do not "simplify" any of them:
//   * the negative-`animation-delay` debounce (armRun's seek) -- mp-life bakes fade-in, hold and
//     fade-out into ONE both-filled keyframe, so its hold CANNOT be extended in place;
//   * holding a peek open by pausing `animationPlayState` and, on release, seeking -3600ms;
//   * ...and, for exactly that reason, the CONFIGURABLE hold is a CORRECTION to the keyframe's own
//     deadline (holdFrom), NEVER a replacement for it: at the default it does NOTHING, so the run
//     stays byte-for-byte the shipped one -- ONE identity, ended by its own animationend. Do NOT
//     "unify" that into always-pause-then-re-arm: that costs every ordinary auto-hide an extra
//     mp-run/mp-run-b flip mid-run (a flicker risk, and 11 red assertions in
//     tools/dev/check_progress_js.js). Do NOT scale `animation-duration` either -- mp-life's stops
//     are PERCENTAGES, so that stretches the fades too;
//   * deriving the peek phase from ELAPSED TIME (plateauAt + HOLD_MS), never from a `showing` flag
//     -- `showing` stays true through the whole fade-out, so a flag-based branch pins the bar at
//     partial opacity;
//   * the mp-run <-> mp-run-b identity alternation, so consecutive runs never share an
//     animation-name for the engine to coalesce a restart with -- and each VERTICAL composition
//     carries its own twin of that pair (mpv-run / mev-run, see RUN_CLASSES_V), because the two
//     vertical stylesheets are namespace-disjoint from the horizontal ones;
//   * the fallback end timer, without which one missing animationend wedges `showing` true forever
//     and the bar shows once and never again;
//   * the POST-DEADLINE surface re-assert -- the engine's default-view-size fallback runs LAST and
//     WINS, so only a late re-assert puts the surface right (see SURFACE_REASSERT_MS).
// The rewind before a COLD show, and the value commit after one, are the two things that DO differ
// between the bars: they are the onRewind / onCommit hooks, not flattened away. The ORIENTATION is
// the third: this module owns the surface/shift/run-identity half of the vertical composition
// (cfg.vert + goVertical) and the bar owns the DOM half (onVertical), because only the bar knows
// its own markup.
//
// The battle windows have NO hot-reload (they pin their resources at client launch), so every tweak
// here costs a full client relaunch: tune in the browser, not in the client.

// --- the transient's timings, from the bars' CSS trailing JSON `meta` blocks -------------------
// Kept as constants rather than read from the CSS: Gameface gives no reliable way to read a
// keyframe's stops, and these numbers ARE the contract with BOTH stylesheets (whose mp-life is
// identically tuned). If a timing changes in a tuner, change it here too.
// Declared as bare `const` and re-exported below so a plain `^const NAME = <int>;` scrape still
// finds them (the mirror tests and the dev harnesses read these out of the source text).
const FADE_IN_MS = 600;              // meta.fadeInMs == the 9.68% keyframe stop of mp-life
const HOLD_MS = 5000;                // meta.holdMs -- the BAKED hold. The LIVE one is the closure's
                                     // `holdMs` (see applyHold): user-configurable, JS-driven, and
                                     // defaulting to exactly this. HOLD_MS stays the keyframe's own
                                     // contract, so SEEK_FADE_OUT below is still the 90.32% stop.
const FADE_OUT_MS = 600;             // meta.fadeOutMs (== fadeInMs in both tuned JSONs)
const TOTAL_MS = FADE_IN_MS + HOLD_MS + FADE_OUT_MS;   // meta.totalMs == mp-life's own 6200ms

// How far to seek INTO mp-life, in ms, when arming a run (armRun turns these into a NEGATIVE
// animation-delay, which starts the animation already that far along without replaying its entry).
// Verified against the emitted keyframes (@keyframes mp-life): the stops are 0 / 9.68 / 90.32 / 100
// of a 6200ms animation, i.e. 0 / 600.16 / 5599.8 / 6200 ms.
//   600  == the 9.68% stop (within 0.2ms): opacity 1 and translateY(0rem) both COMPLETE, so the bar
//           sits exactly at the hold plateau and does not re-flash or re-slide.
//   5600 == the 90.32% stop: the instant the fade-out begins.

// --- THE RE-ASSERT: LOAD-BEARING, DO NOT DELETE ---------------------------------------------
// Live-measured: the engine's size-calculation deadline expired ~2.2s after the view loaded
// (resizeViewRem at 04.8s; the `Size calculation timeout` + its "Set the default view size" action
// at 06.2s, clobbering the pushed size back to the 256x256 default -- THE FALLBACK RUNS LAST AND
// WINS, which is why pushing the size earlier can never help). A static in-flow #moe-bar-box does
// NOT satisfy the engine's measurement; that premise was tested and DISPROVEN. So this re-assert is
// the ONLY thing that puts the surface right, and it is permanent. 4000ms is comfortably past the
// observed ~2.2s.
// It is load-bearing TWICE: `settled` flips off the back of it, because the re-assert IS the event
// that makes the surface correct. Before it the surface is the 256x256 fallback -- which CLIPS the
// composition and, since Python's anchor_centred_reduced computes its term from the real surface
// height (domain/constants.*_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT), places the bar far too high. Delete either half and
// the bug comes back.
const SURFACE_REASSERT_MS = 4000;
// Slack between the re-assert and letting the bar show. The resize round-trips through C++
// (Window._cResized -> onSizeChanged -> bridge/bar_window._place re-reads the movable extent), so
// the surface is only correct -- and the window only re-placed -- a beat AFTER the push. 250ms is
// far more than an engine callback needs and is not user-visible: it lands ~4.25s into a battle,
// inside a window where nothing shows anyway.
const SURFACE_SETTLE_MS = 250;

// Margin on the fallback end timer so it always LOSES to a working animationend (which fires at
// exactly the run's remaining duration). Not a tuned CSS value -- pure slack.
const END_MARGIN_MS = 250;

// THE SURFACE RECT IS THE MOUSE HIT RECT -- exactly why WindowFlags.WINDOW_FULLSCREEN was rejected
// for these windows (bridge/battle_view.py). A surface spanning most of screen centre would be an
// input-stealing strip, and these bars are purely decorative and must never take input. So collapse
// the input rect to nothing, PERMANENTLY -- this document needs no mouse input at ALL any more: the
// Ctrl+drag reposition is driven entirely from Python (adapter/battle_input samples the keys,
// bridge/bar_window re-places the window from the live cursor), so the rect that used to be OPENED
// for the gesture never opens again. Confirmed against WG's own JS wrapper (gui-part3.pkg
// battle/battle_notifier/BattleNotifierView/BattleNotifierView.js), against a LIVE decompile, not
// just this file's own memory of one:
//   * the order is (top, right, bottom, left, 15) -- CONFIRMED;
//   * WG's own wrapper passes FOUR EQUAL VALUES, always -- so arg order is MOOT there, and matters
//     here only if the four are NOT equal;
//   * an OVERSIZED padding is ACCEPTED, not rejected -- a real capture logged 240 accepted against a
//     92-tall surface. NEGATIVE values are what gets rejected, not an oversized positive one.
// ONE SHARED VALUE ACROSS ALL FOUR SIDES, per that recorded design -- NOT a per-axis pair. A prior
// revision of this file split hitPad into hitPadX/hitPadY on the theory that `Math.ceil(Math.max(
// viewW, viewH) / 2)` on all four sides "over-pads the smaller axis into a negative extent instead
// of the exact zero a real collapse needs" -- but per the CONFIRMED behaviour above, an oversized
// (or negative-implying) padding is exactly what WG's own wrapper already ships and the engine
// already accepts; the "exact zero" the split chased was never necessary, and splitting it
// reintroduced two risks the uniform value never had: sensitivity to the (top, right, bottom, left)
// ARGUMENT ORDER (moot when all four are equal, live when they differ) and sensitivity to WHICH
// AXIS'S size the pad happens to be derived from at push time. `Math.ceil(Math.max(viewW, viewH) /
// 2)` on all four sides collapses BOTH axes to nothing, is immune to the argument order, and is the
// smaller diff. Revert target if this file's hit collapse is ever found not to hold at runtime.
// HIT_MAGIC mirrors WG's constant (its own wrapper always passes this literal 15 too); its meaning
// is unknown, so the call is retried without it if the 5-argument form is rejected.
const HIT_MAGIC = 15;

// --- THE "LARGE" SIZE MODE (mod_settings.progress_bar_size, pushed as the VM's `barSize`) -----
// TWO factors, one per axis, and they are the only two numbers the whole feature has. Defined HERE,
// once, for both bars (Python's half is the two *_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT_LARGE constants).
//
// SIZE_F IS DELIVERED BY THE ROOT FONT SIZE AND NOTHING ELSE. The rem->px factor in Gameface IS the
// root font size, and WG's own bootstrap (gui/gameface/js/index.js) ends by writing it from
// `self.onScaleUpdated` -- a bootstrap our REGISTERED views never load, which is exactly why every
// comment in this mod asserts 1rem == 1 logical px. So one write of `base * SIZE_F` re-lays the whole
// composition 1.25x larger, CRISPLY (a real reflow, not a bitmap upscale), and leaves every %, em,
// `contain`, gradient stop and derived icon background-size ratio correctly untouched: height, fonts,
// icon boxes, glow radii, vertical gaps and mp-life's slide all scale with NO CSS edit at all.
// SIZE_XF is what is left over: an x-length must reach 5/3 TOTAL, and the root font already gives it
// SIZE_F, so the stylesheets' one appended `.mp-lg` block re-declares ONLY the x-lengths, multiplied
// by this. 1.25 * 4/3 == 5/3 exactly (~1.667x -- was 1.5 * 4/3 == 2x before the Large mode was
// eased off a pure 1.5x/2x scale-up).
// THE ENGINE APIs ARE NOT AFFECTED BY OUR ROOT FONT: resizeViewRem / setHitAreaPaddingsRem are C++
// and take logical px, so their arguments carry BOTH factors (see applySize). The CSS `left`/`top`
// rigid shift stays in rem and self-scales, which is why shiftY needs no term at all.

const SIZE_XF = 4 / 3;



// Two interchangeable arming classes, each bound to its OWN identically-tuned @keyframes (the

//
// THE VERTICAL COMPOSITIONS CARRY THEIR OWN PAIR, and it is PER BAR rather than one shared vertical
// pair: the two vertical stylesheets are namespace-disjoint from the horizontal ones by design
// (.mpv-* on MoEProgressVertical.css, .mev-* on MoEEfficiencyVertical.css -- the horizontal pair
// shares .mp-* only because each registered view is its own document), so each emits its own twin
// under its own prefix. Both orientations' keyframes are IDENTICALLY tuned -- same 6200ms, same
// four stops, same 20rem translateY slide -- which is why one set of timing constants above serves
// all four and no bar owes a second clock. The horizontal pair below is the shipped default; a bar
// supplies its vertical pair through cfg.vert.run / cfg.vert.life (see createTransient).

//                                 further sideways than the box does and `pad` alone would clip it.
//                                 Only the vertical Moving Average bar needs one (its captions are
//                                 right-anchored and grow LEFTWARD past .mpv-backdrop by design --
//                                 the backdrop deliberately does not cover them), so it is supplied
//                                 as `vert.padX`; everything else leaves padX == pad and the
//                                 four-sided-uniform derivation is unchanged byte-for-byte.
//                                 IT IS ONE VALUE FOR BOTH SIDES, DELIBERATELY, and that is not a
//                                 simplification -- it is the guarantee. The centred (Damage Log)
//                                 anchor is `max_x // 2` in Python with NO x term at all
//                                 (positioning.anchor_centred_reduced), which centres the SURFACE
//                                 and therefore only centres the BAR while the surface brackets the
//                                 track evenly. A per-side pad would let a caller silently slide
//                                 every centred placement by half the asymmetry; this shape cannot
//                                 express that. Pay the unused slack on the other side instead --
//                                 the surface rect is invisible (the hit rect is collapsed to
//                                 nothing off `Math.max(viewW, viewH)`, unconditionally, regardless
//                                 of which axis padX widens), so a wider surface costs literally
//                                 nothing.
//                                 It is an X length like `pad` and, like `pad`, it does NOT carry
//                                 SIZE_XF: it is a rem-space allowance for rem-sized caption INK,
//                                 which the root font already scales by SIZE_F alone.
//   padXR/padXRLarge              OPTIONAL, default `padX`/`padXR`. The RIGHT-side twin of `padX`,
//                                 for a composition whose two sides need DIFFERENT slack -- so far
//                                 only the two VERTICAL, Minimap-anchored bars, whose left side
//                                 carries the caption ink (padX, above) while their right side faces
//                                 the minimap and needs only cover the TRACK's own tick overhang, not
//                                 the ink. Unlike `padX`, splitting this one is SAFE precisely because
//                                 it is never paired with the centred (Damage Log) anchor's `max_x //
//                                 2` (positioning.anchor_centred_reduced has no X term and needs the
//                                 surface symmetric to stay centred on the track -- see padX's own
//                                 note); the Minimap anchor (positioning.anchor_minimap) reads
//                                 `edge_x` off the LEFT side alone (padX, boxLeft, trackW) and has no
//                                 term for the surface's overall width at all, so shrinking the RIGHT
//                                 side moves nothing the placement math depends on and the bar does
//                                 not move on screen. May be NEGATIVE (and, for both shipped bars,
//                                 is): the composition's own backdrop bleeds further right than the
//                                 track needs, and a negative padXR clips that decorative bleed at the
//                                 surface edge exactly the way `clipB` already clips the bottom bleed
//                                 -- see domain/constants.py's *_MM_TRACK_X note and the bars' own V_
//                                 PAD_X_REM notes for the numbers. `padXRLarge` exists because the
//                                 target it has to hit (the Python-side `edge_x` it must clear) is
//                                 itself a hand-corrected, not purely `*SIZE_XF`-scaled, number at
//                                 Large -- so, like MM_TICK_OVERHANG_LARGE, it is its own literal.
//   clipB                         OPTIONAL, default 0. Rem of the box's BOTTOM that the surface
//                                 deliberately does NOT cover, i.e. how much backdrop bleed is
//                                 CLIPPED at the surface's bottom edge. The ONE asymmetry in an
//                                 otherwise four-sided-uniform `pad`, and it exists because the
//                                 engine clamps every window into [0, space - surface] in compiled
//                                 C++ (see bridge/bar_window's _extent, which DEPENDS on that
//                                 clamp): the surface's bottom edge can therefore never go below the
//                                 screen's, so the ONLY way to bring a bottom-anchored composition
//                                 closer to the screen's bottom edge is to make its surface shorter.
//                                 Both VERTICAL compositions use it (their tuners' approved look has
//                                 the backdrop's lower bleed hanging off the stage bottom); the
//                                 horizontal pair leaves it 0 and keeps the plain box + 2*pad.
//                                 It is a Y length, so it carries SIZE_F alone via applySize's `f`
//                                 and NEVER SIZE_XF. It never touches `shiftY`, so the composition
//                                 does not move inside its surface and the mirrored Python constants
//                                 (VERTICAL_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT, MM_TRACK_Y) are UNCHANGED by it.
//   onRewind(atCurrent)           OPTIONAL. Called inside a cold show, BEFORE the run is armed, to

//                                 which -- NOT cosmetic: after a cold show the run class was just
//                                 added and onRewind wrote a resting value, so the new target must
//                                 land in a LATER frame (requestAnimationFrame); a warm re-trigger

    //       only reached this document while the cursor stayed inside the bar-sized rect. Any gain
    //       error or round-trip lag let the cursor drift out; events stopped, then resumed, and the

    //      timer that could outlive it. It then re-renders the model we already hold, so a
