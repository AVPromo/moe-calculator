// 14th_ua's MoE Calculator -- in-battle centre-screen DAMAGE EFFICIENCY bar. Front-end of a
// STANDALONE OpenWG-registered Gameface view (MoEEfficiencyView.html, registered via
// mods/configs/res_map/MoEEfficiencyView.json) that bridge/efficiency_view.py opens as a
// CONTENT-SIZED (NOT full-screen), input-transparent window centred over the battle HUD. Do NOT
// re-add full-screen sizing / width:100% -- see bridge/battle_view.py for the Ctrl+click/hover
// input-steal that cost us.
//
// THIS IS THE RADIO ALTERNATIVE to the Moving Average bar (MoEProgress.js): Python opens exactly
// ONE of the two, which is the only reason both stylesheets can own #moe-bar-root and the .mp-*
// prefix. Never <link> both in one document.
//
// TWO ORIENTATIONS, ONE DOCUMENT, and that is NOT a contradiction of the line above: this document
// DOES <link> a second stylesheet, MoEEfficiencyVertical.css, whose prefix (.mev-*) is disjoint from
// .mp-* by construction -- so the only selectors that can collide are `body`, `#moe-bar-box` and
// `#moe-bar-root`, and those three are the only ones the vertical sheet scopes under its `body.mev`
// class. Which composition draws comes from mod_settings' progress_bar_orientation, pushed as the
// VM's `vertical`, as a MOUNT-TIME branch (goVertical) -- NOT a second res_map layout, because a new
// itemID would cost every user a one-time client restart. The PLACEMENT half is Python's and already
// orientation-aware (bridge/bar_window._resolve).
//
// Because this is a registered view, OUR data model (EfficiencyVM) IS the view's own root
// ViewModel: a bare ModelObserver() with NO feature name, fields read DIRECTLY off the root
// (model.damage, ...). No nested submodel and NO unwrap dance -- that is only the garage's
// nested-model path.
//
// WHAT THE BAR SHOWS: THIS battle's combined damage plotted against all FOUR of the tank's mark
// requirements at once -- five damage stops [0, r65, r85, r95, r100] mapped onto four visually
// EQUAL quarters. The four requirement ticks/captions are pinned at 25/50/75/100 % in the CSS;
// only the fill, the current tick and its caption are positioned from here.
//
// AND THE AXIS ARITHMETIC IS NOT DONE HERE. Unlike MoEProgress.js (which derives its position from
// the pushed axis ends), Python pushes `barX` (0..100 % of the bar) and `band` (0..4, the highest
// requirement PASSED, `>=` INCLUSIVE) as finished values -- domain/battle_builder.efficiency_bar_x
// and efficiency_band. Do NOT recompute either here: the inclusive-boundary rule must live in
// exactly one place, and it is unit-tested there. The four r* props are for the CAPTION NUMERALS
// only. `.met` on a requirement tick likewise comes off `band` (stop i is met iff i <= band), not
// off a damage comparison.
//
// THE LOOK IS THE TUNER'S AND NOT NEGOTIABLE: MoEEfficiency.css is tools/dev/eff_bar_tuner.html's
// emit verbatim (reproducible with `node tools/dev/emit_eff_css.js`) plus two marked hand-added
// blocks, and this file is a port of that tuner's own preview pass (apply / showDelta / replay)
// crossed with MoEProgress.js's proven transient machinery. Every number below is mirrored from
// that stylesheet's trailing JSON `meta` block. The battle window has NO hot-reload (it pins its
// resources at client launch), so every tweak here costs a full client relaunch: tune in the
// browser, not in the client.
//
// pointer-events:none throughout (in the CSS) -- pure HUD info, never an input target.
import { ModelObserver } from "../../libs/model.js";
// The transient machinery -- arming, the negative-delay debounce, the Alt peek's pause/seek, the
// end race and the surface re-assert -- is SHARED with MoEProgress.js. Every behaviour in there cost
// a client relaunch to find; read its header before changing anything that touches timing.
// Separate documents, so this module is instantiated twice with no cross-talk.

// The pushed LARGE size mode (VM `barSize`), mirrored here because capClampPct needs it -- it is the
// one place on either bar that mixes a MEASURED px width with rem literals, so the 1rem == 1 logical
// px identity it rests on breaks under the large mode's 1.25x root font. The transient owns everything
// else about the flag (see its SIZE_F / SIZE_XF).
let large = false;

// --- the surface, and the rigid shift into it ----------------------------------------------
// A Gameface view PUSHES its own size to C++ through the `viewEnv` global
// (viewEnv.resizeViewRem(w, h), rem == logical px); a view that never calls it gets the engine's
// "default view size" fallback after a `Size calculation timeout` -- a flat 256x256 logical px.
// There is NO Python-side and NO res_map lever for this (see bridge/efficiency_view.py), and
// pushing the size is not sufficient on its own: the engine ALSO tries to measure the document and
// ITS FALLBACK RUNS LAST AND WINS. See SURFACE_REASSERT_MS.
//
// The composition's bounding box, document origin at (0,0) and 1rem == 1 logical px, IS
// .mp-backdrop -- left -80rem / top -40rem / 460 wide / 96 tall (MoEEfficiency.css; the emitted
// value, asserted by tools/dev/check_eff_css.js). Everything else fits inside it with
// room to spare, measured against the emit rather than guessed:
//   * TOP: the .mp-cap.up numeral's box bottom sits at -12rem (bottom:100% of the 3rem track, then
//     translateY(-12rem)), so at a 16rem font with its pinned 20.5rem line box its top is ~-32.5
//     and its 6rem band glow reaches ~-38.5. Its out-of-flow glyph and the current tick's 6rem glow
//     are shallower still.
//   * BOTTOM: .mp-cap.dn tops out at 15rem (top:100% + margin-top:12rem) and its pinned 15.5rem
//     line box reaches ~30.5 -- its .mp-d delta (translate(4.2, 2.5)) hangs deeper still, to ~33.
//   * SIDES: .mp-cap.r4 sits at 100 % (x == 300) and the current caption's delta hangs off its
//     right edge, reaching ~375 at four digits -- which is precisely why meta.capClamp's right
//     bound is 376. The clamp below keeps it there whatever the digits do.
// So the surface is that box plus PAD_REM of slack on all four sides, and the whole composition is
// rigidly translated by that much so NOTHING sits at a negative coordinate -- an origin overflow
// is clipped no matter how big the surface is.
//
// NOT A THIRD COPY: MoEProgressView.html's sizing shim is sized to that bar's surface, but THIS
// document's #moe-bar-box is 460x51rem straight out of the tuner's emit (the bar plus its two
// caption rows). Leave it emitted -- the box provably does not stop the size timeout anyway, so
// its exact value buys nothing, and hand-editing it would be silent drift from the emit.
// These five ARE this bar's surface contract and stay HERE, per bar. MoEBarTransient derives the
// rest from them (its box*/pad arguments), exactly as this file used to:
//   VIEW_W_REM = BOX_W_REM + 2 * PAD_REM == 480     SHIFT_X_REM = PAD_REM - BOX_LEFT_REM == 90
//   VIEW_H_REM = BOX_H_REM + 2 * PAD_REM == 116     SHIFT_Y_REM = PAD_REM - BOX_TOP_REM  == 50
// SHIFT_Y_REM is MIRRORED (negated) in Python as
// domain/constants.EFFICIENCY_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT, so changing BOX_TOP_REM or PAD_REM moves the bar on
// screen until that constant follows. The hit padding and the re-assert timing live in the shared
// module (its HIT_MAGIC / SURFACE_REASSERT_MS -- both LOAD-BEARING, read its header).
const BOX_LEFT_REM = -80;                            // .mp-backdrop's left  == leftmost edge
const BOX_TOP_REM = -40;                             // .mp-backdrop's top   == topmost edge
const BOX_W_REM = 460;                               // .mp-backdrop's width  (== meta.boxWRem)
const BOX_H_REM = 96;                                // .mp-backdrop's height
const PAD_REM = 10;                                  // slack for the shadow/glow bleed

// --- THE VERTICAL ORIENTATION (mod_settings.progress_bar_orientation, pushed as the VM's
// `vertical`) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A SECOND COMPOSITION IN THE SAME DOCUMENT, not a restyle of this one: its own stylesheet
// (MoEEfficiencyVertical.css, <link>ed alongside MoEEfficiency.css from MoEEfficiencyView.html),
// its own namespace-disjoint prefix (.mev-*), its own DOM order (numeral BEFORE icon, delta LEFT of
// the numeral) and its own surface. NO second res_map entry: orientation is a MOUNT-TIME branch,
// and a new itemID would cost every user a one-time client restart.
//
// V_BOX_* IS .mev-backdrop, exactly as BOX_* above is .mp-backdrop. Note it is NOT a transpose of
// these four -- the vertical tuner's own tuned lengths -- but its TOP and HEIGHT are IDENTICAL to
// the vertical Moving Average bar's (-80 / 360), which is why the two share ONE Python shift
// constant where their horizontal siblings need -50 and -44 apiece:
//   V_VIEW_W_REM = V_BOX_W_REM + V_PAD_X_REM        V_SHIFT_X_REM = V_PAD_X_REM - V_BOX_LEFT_REM == 92
//               + V_PAD_XR_REM == 98 (a SPLIT pad now -- see both constants' own notes below)
//   V_VIEW_H_REM = V_BOX_H_REM + 2 * PAD_REM
//                               - V_CLIP_B_REM == 318 V_SHIFT_Y_REM = PAD_REM - V_BOX_TOP_REM  == 90
// THE X AXIS IS NOT box + PAD_REM EITHER -- SAME DEFECT THE MOVING AVERAGE BAR ALREADY FIXED
// (MoEProgress.js's V_PAD_X_REM note carries the mechanism in full; only the numbers differ here).
// Every caption here is RIGHT-ANCHORED (`right: 100%`, MoEEfficiencyVertical.css's .mev-cap) and
// grows LEFTWARD from a fixed edge, same as the sibling bar's captions, so "left" is the overflow
// direction for every one of the maintainer's nudges below.
// THIS WENT THROUGH TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE SAME BUG, because the first one watched only one
// caption family:
//   PASS 1 (14rem): the per-mark gap pass (icon_gap_tuner.html) pushed mark_2/mark_3 far enough
//     that PAD_REM's flat 10rem no longer covered them. But that pass's own re-derivation used the
//     WRONG icon width for the mark rows (13rem, the shared base `.mev-ico` box) instead of the
//     16rem `.mev-ico.mk` override the mark icons actually render at (CSS specificity: `.mev-ico.mk`
//     beats bare `.mev-ico`), AND it never checked `.mev-cap.bt` (the current-damage + delta row) at
//     all -- exactly the "a gate that only watches one caption" mistake the Moving Average bar's own
//     capC-is-the-extreme derivation already exists to warn against.
//   PASS 2 (52rem, this one): re-derives EVERY row, worst case, 4-digit+comma numerals throughout
//     (font-size / icon width / icon margin-left all read from the shipped CSS, never transcribed):
//       r1 (mk1, tx -2):  2 + 16(.mev-ico.mk) + (-1)(mk shared margin) + 26.64(numeral) + 1(halo) == 44.64
//       r2 (mk2, tx -4):  4 + 16 + 0.5 + 26.64 + 1 == 48.14
//       r3 (mk3, tx -6):  6 + 16 + 3.0 + 26.64 + 1 == 52.64
//       tp (bm, tx -3+7=4, AFTER the maintainer's "move the top block left 4px" nudge, was tx 8):
//         -4 + 14(.mev-ico.bm) + 1.253 + 26.64 + 1 == 38.89
//       bt (dmg, tx -3+6=3, AFTER the maintainer's "move the bottom block left 7px" nudge, was
//         tx 10): the BARE signed delta (no parens, unlike the sibling bar's) sits LEFT of the
//         numeral via its own translate(-4.2rem, ...), so it -- not the numeral -- is the worst
//         point:
//         -3 + 16(.mev-ico.dmg) + 1(shared margin) + 35.52("3,050" at 16rem) + 4.2(delta gap)
//           + 32.56("+2,970" at 12rem, sign+4digits+comma, no parens) + 1(halo) == 87.28
//     .bt IS THIS FILE'S EXTREME (87.28 > 52.64 > 48.14 > 44.64 > 38.89), exactly as .mpv-capC is
//     for the Moving Average bar's sheet -- and by the SAME margin (each grew its own V_PAD_X_REM
//     by exactly its own nudge's device-px count and landed on ~4.5rem of margin, not a coincidence,
//     just two rows with the same shape being pushed by the same kind of nudge):
//       V_PAD_X_REM == 92 + V_BOX_LEFT_REM == 92 - 40 == 52   (allowance 92, reach 87.28, margin 4.72)
// tests/test_efficiency_surface_mirror.py::test_the_vertical_captions_fit_inside_the_surface is
// the GATE on all of this, re-deriving every row (not just the mark rows) from the stylesheet
// rather than trusting this note.
// GROWING THIS MOVES THE TRACK INSIDE THE SURFACE, so domain/constants.EFFICIENCY_MM_TRACK_X(
// _LARGE) had to grow with it by the exact same amount (in logical px, i.e. *SIZE_F under Large)
// or the visible bar would slide RIGHT into the minimap -- see that constant's own comment.
// V_SHIFT_Y_REM is MIRRORED (negated) in Python as domain/constants.VERTICAL_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT (-90,
// -113 for Large == -round(90 * SIZE_F)). #moe-bar-box in MoEEfficiencyVertical.css is sized to the
// derived surface -- and unlike the horizontal file's box (left at the tuner's own emitted 460x55,
// deliberately not a surface copy) that one IS a third copy: keep it in lockstep.
//
// THE SURFACE IS THE ONLY SIDE THAT IS NOT box + PAD_REM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (V_CLIP_B_REM).
// Read the sibling MoEProgress.js's own V_CLIP_B_REM note first -- the mechanism, the engine clamp it
// works around and the Large-mode reasoning are IDENTICAL and are written out once, there. Only the
// two numbers differ, because the two vertical tuners' bottom gaps differ:
//   V_CLIP_B_REM == (V_BOX_H_REM + 2*PAD_REM) - (V_SHIFT_Y_REM + barLen + bottomGap)
//                == 380 - (90 + 200 + 28) == 62
// `bottomGap` 28 is THIS bar's tuned value (tools/dev/eff_bar_tuner_vertical.html:470), against the
// Moving Average tuner's 30 -- a difference that used to be UNOBSERVABLE (both were below the shared
// 90 of slack, so the clamp flushed either to the same place) and is observable now, which is exactly
// why domain/constants' single MM_GAP_BOTTOM is split per bar in the same change.
// The surface's below-the-track slack becomes 318 - 290 == 28 == the tuned gap exactly (290 is
// V_SHIFT_Y_REM + barLen == domain/constants.MM_TRACK_Y, which this does NOT move). Under Large the
// pushed surface is round(318 * SIZE_F) == 398 against MM_TRACK_Y_LARGE 363, i.e. 35 of slack ==
// 28 * SIZE_F exactly -- so the fixed 28 is unreachable there and the engine's flush delivers the
// scaled gap, which is the sibling's 30 -> 37 case with this bar's own two numbers.
// WHAT IT COSTS, DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED CSS, is 3.5rem of clearance on the bottom caption's ink and
// nothing else. .mev-cap.bt (MoEEfficiencyVertical.css) is `top: 100%` + `margin-top: 3rem` off the
// track's bottom end and its flex row is `line-height: 20.5rem` tall (the numeral's line box beats its
// 16rem .dmg icon; the delta is position:absolute and contributes no height at all), so its box ends
// 3 + 20.5 == 23.5rem below the track; the numeral's 1rem dark-drop text-shadow radius reaches 24.5,
// the icon's translateY(0.5rem) + its ::before 106% glow (3% of 16rem) reaches 22.2, and the delta --
// `top: 0` + translate(_, 1.5rem), 15.5rem tall, + 1rem of drop -- reaches 21.0. So the deepest ink is
// 24.5 against 28 of slack. The ONLY thing past the edge is the band glow's soft tail (the 6rem blur
// on .mev-cap.bt .mev-v under every #moe-bar-root.mev-b-* band, reaching ~29.5), which the tuner clips
// at its own stage bottom at the same 28.
// THE 256x256 SIZE-TIMEOUT FALLBACK STILL RUNS LAST AND STILL WINS here, and the vertical surface is
// pushed and RE-ASSERTED after the deadline by the same shared machinery (MoEBarTransient's
// SURFACE_REASSERT_MS); each push round-trips back as onSizeChanged -> bar_window._place, which is
// what makes the placement agree with the surface.
// FOUR DURABLE FACTS, established by reading the source rather than assuming (a maintainer once
// saw the minimap's first column "covered by a dark panel" and the fix took four rounds to land):
//   1. THE BACKDROP IS NOT MEANT TO COVER THE RIGHT-ANCHORED CAPTIONS -- only V_PAD_X_REM (above)
//      was ever sized for their ink. .mev-backdrop is a SEPARATE rectangle, drawn for the
//      shadow/glow bleed around the TRACK, and r1-r3/tp/bt already reach far past it by design (see
//      the V_PAD_X_REM derivation above -- 38.89 to 87.28rem, against a 40rem backdrop bleed). Do
//      not "fix" a clip by widening the backdrop; that is V_PAD_X_REM's job, on the SURFACE, which
//      is never drawn.
//   2. THE VERTICAL BAR'S BACKDROP HAS NO SYMMETRY CONTRACT. The symmetry test in this repo
//      (`test_the_large_backdrop_stays_symmetric_about_the_track`) covers ONLY the HORIZONTAL bar's
//      `.mp-backdrop`, because `anchor_centred_reduced`'s `max_x // 2` has no X term and only
//      centres the BAR by centring the SURFACE -- true for the Damage Log (horizontal) anchor.
//      Fixed+Vertical resolves through `anchor_minimap` instead (bar_window._resolve), whose
//      `x = space_x - mm_size - gap - overhang - edge_x` reads `edge_x` (EFFICIENCY_MM_TRACK_X) and
//      NOTHING about the backdrop's own width or left. Trimming `.mev-backdrop` asymmetrically
//      (this file's own V_BOX_W_REM, leaving V_BOX_LEFT_REM alone) moves nothing the placement math
//      depends on.
//   3. THE BACKDROP TRIM (V_BOX_W_REM 96 -> 54) WAS REAL WORK -- KEEP IT. A maintainer report of
//      the backdrop "sitting well clear of the minimap" turned out to describe a DIFFERENT panel;
//      measured live on the sibling Moving Average bar (same mechanism, same minimap edge), this
//      bar's own backdrop right edge (V_PAD_X_REM + V_BOX_W_REM == 52+54==106) landed EXACTLY on
//      the minimap's own left edge (EFFICIENCY_MM_TRACK_X + MM_GAP + MM_TICK_OVERHANG ==
//      95+8+3==106) -- zero overlap, by design, at the tuned 54, AT THE TIME (the shared MM_GAP
//      was 8). Reverting to 96 (right edge 148) would reopen a real 42rem overlap. Do not touch
//      V_BOX_W_REM again without a live measurement to justify it.
//      SINCE THEN, PLACEMENT MOVED CLOSER TO THE MINIMAP (domain/constants.EFFICIENCY_MM_GAP
//      (_LARGE), 3/3, replacing the shared MM_GAP(8) for this bar's own anchor) -- the backdrop's
//      own DRAWN right edge no longer sits flush with the minimap's now-closer left edge. Not a
//      regression: fact 4 below already established the DRAWN backdrop is not what clears the
//      minimap, the invisible SURFACE is (V_PAD_XR_REM/_LARGE), and the surface still clears it
//      with a real, checked margin at the new gap -- see V_PAD_XR_REM's own derivation below.
//   4. THE ACTUAL CULPRIT WAS THE INVISIBLE SURFACE'S OWN RIGHT PAD, NEVER UPDATED TO MATCH. The
//      backdrop trim shrank the DRAWN rect; nothing shrank the SURFACE (the mouse-hit-blocking rect
//      per this file's header) on that side, so it stayed the OLD symmetric V_PAD_X_REM(52) past
//      the ALREADY-TRIMMED backdrop -- see MoEBarTransient.js's `padXR`/`padXRLarge` arg notes for
//      the fix (a SEPARATE, smaller right pad, V_PAD_XR_REM/_LARGE below) and V_PAD_XR_REM's own
//      derivation, mirroring the sibling Moving Average bar's live-measured diagnosis exactly.
//      Because the fix only shrinks the RIGHT pad and V_PAD_X_REM (the LEFT side, where the caption
//      ink and the track itself both live) is untouched, `shiftX` and therefore
//      EFFICIENCY_MM_TRACK_X(_LARGE) -- both pure functions of the LEFT side alone -- need no
//      correction, and the bar does not move on screen.

// for the full mechanism; only the numbers differ here, and it is a SEPARATE knob from the backdrop's
// own V_BOX_W_REM trim above: that trim shrinks what is DRAWN, this shrinks what is CLICK-BLOCKING
// (the surface, never drawn).
// UNLIKE THE MOVING AVERAGE BAR, EFFICIENCY_MM_TRACK_X CARRIES NO HAND CORRECTION ("pure derivation,
// no correction" -- domain/constants.py's own comment), so it IS this bar's true local tick position
// and needs no re-derivation the way the sibling file's fact 5 does. Solved against
// MoEBarTransient.applySize's own formula (viewW == round((boxW*xf + padX + padXR) * f)) for the
// tick's own visible right edge PLUS a small, deliberate MARGIN (+2 logical/document px, flat, NOT
// xf-scaled) -- a flush boundary (viewW == tick-right exactly, zero margin) is the "rounding could
// shave a px and eat the ink" risk the margin exists to head off, mirroring the sibling file's fact 5:
//   Default (xf=f=1):  tick-right == 95 + 3 == 98  ->  viewW == 98 + 2 == 100  ->
//     padXR == 100 - V_BOX_W_REM(54) - V_PAD_X_REM(52) == -6
//   Large:  tick-right_pre_f == 137/SIZE_F... computed directly, not via the rounded PX constant:
//     shiftX_large_pre_f(316/3) + trackW_large(4) + overhang_large_pre_f(4) == 340/3 ~= 113.333
//     (renders at 113.333*SIZE_F ~= 141.667 device px) -> viewW_pre_f == 340/3 + 2 == 346/3 ~= 115.333

// ...and THE VERTICAL COMPOSITION'S markup, tools/dev/eff_bar_tuner_vertical.html's stage verbatim.

// layout and none free to "tidy":
//   * NUMERAL BEFORE ICON in every caption (the icon trails, away from the track), and the DELTA
//     FIRST on the current caption. That ordering is what makes the shared right:100% anchor
//     digit-count invariant: the icon is the LAST in-flow child, flush against a FIXED edge, so only
//     the numeral grows and it grows leftward. Reversing it re-introduces the exact defect that
//     shipped once on the horizontal Moving Average bar.
//   * the four requirement captions split by ROLE, not one `dn` class: r1-r3 are `lf` (each beside
//     its own 25/50/75% tick) and r4 is `tp` (a static cap above the track's TOP end), because a
//     vertical axis has no single "below the track" side to share.
//   * the current caption is `bt mev-capC` -- a static cap below the BOTTOM end. It keeps mev-capC
//     purely so the ref lookup below is one selector for both orientations.
//   * every caption is a SIBLING of .mev-track rather than a child, exactly as the tuner has them

//     only keeps the diff against the tuner readable).

// appear at battle start. (There is deliberately no `rev` counter on EfficiencyVM -- the battle

// --- THE DELTA LATCH (derived HERE; EfficiencyVM carries no damageDelta) --------------------
// `peak` is the HIGH-WATER mark of this battle's combined damage, deliberately NOT the previous
// push's value: combined damage SUBTRACTS team damage, so the total can move DOWN, and the latch
// must measure only the rise above the highest total already seen -- a friendly-fire dip followed
// by a hit reports the gain over the old peak, never the dip plus the hit. `delta` then PERSISTS
// until superseded, because an efficiency tick that moved nothing (a spot, a dip, an arena period
// change, an Alt press) must keep showing the increment the player is reading; 0 == none yet.
//
// A NEW HIGH-WATER MARK IS ALSO THE ONLY THING THAT MAY POP THE BAR OPEN (see `gained` in render).
// "The value changed" and "the player gained damage" are NOT the same event: team damage
// subtracting from the combined total changes the value, and re-showing the bar for it would
// re-flash an increment the player has already read, carrying no new information.
//
// `epoch` is the battleEpoch `peak`/`delta` belong to. Python bumps a monotonic counter once per
// battle mount (bridge/battle_bridge._battle_epoch) and pushes it on every efficiency tick, so a
// change in it IS the battle boundary -- there is no longer any inference from the total having
// restarted low (battle N+1's first tick can read higher than battle N's peak, and then an Alt peek
// early in N+1 rendered N's stale increment). It deliberately does NOT live in `last`: a hide drops
// that baseline mid-battle, while the latch has to survive one. 0 == the counter's value before the
// first battle, so the first push of the first battle resets an already-empty latch for free.
//
// NO COMPARISON MAY NAME `damage` ON ITS OWN LINE. tools/dev/check_efficiency_js.js scans the
// comment-stripped source for a comparison operator sharing a line with `damage` or an r* stop,
// because the rule it guards is that the `>=`-INCLUSIVE damage-vs-REQUIREMENT test lives in Python
// (domain.efficiency_band) and nothing here may re-derive it. This latch is damage-vs-damage and
// touches no requirement, so it reads the total into `total` first and compares THAT.

// offsetWidth is the NUMERAL only (the icon and the delta are out of flow), which is why the larger
// of the two overhangs is added back, the icon's with its transform gap. A zero measured width
// (nothing laid out yet) simply degrades to no clamp.
//
// THE TWO SIZE FACTORS BOTH LAND HERE, and this is the ONE function on either bar where the
// 1rem == 1 logical px identity is load-bearing rather than incidental:
//   * every rem CONSTANT above is an x-length (the bar's width, the corridor's two bounds, the icon's
//     transform gap), so each takes SIZE_XF -- the corridor bounds included, since they are the
//     backdrop inset by an equal x-length each side and so scale with it;
//   * offsetWidth is MEASURED PX, and under the large mode's root font 1rem is SIZE_F px, so
//     every measurement is divided back into document rem. A caption's width in rem is unchanged by
//     the root font (its font-size is a rem too), which is exactly why this cannot be normalised

    // fixture) must degrade to the SHIPPED behaviour, which is "a hit raises the bar". The delta
