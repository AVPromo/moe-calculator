// 14th_ua's MoE Calculator -- in-battle centre-screen MoE progress bar (the TRANSIENT one; the
// always-on corner readout is MoEBattle.js). Front-end of a STANDALONE OpenWG-registered Gameface
// view (MoEProgressView.html, registered via mods/configs/res_map/MoEProgressView.json) that
// bridge/progress_view.py opens as a CONTENT-SIZED (NOT full-screen), input-transparent window
// centred over the battle HUD. Do NOT re-add full-screen sizing / width:100% -- see
// bridge/battle_view.py for the Ctrl+click/hover input-steal that cost us.
//
// Because this is a registered view, OUR data model (ProgressVM) IS the view's own root
// ViewModel: a bare ModelObserver() with NO feature name, fields read DIRECTLY off the root
// (model.projAvg, ...). No nested submodel and NO unwrap dance -- that is only the garage's
// nested-model path.
//
// WHAT THE BAR SHOWS: where the career moving-average combined damage sits between the
// requirement for the mark you HOLD and the requirement for the next one, and the nudge THIS
// battle contributes. Everything derived here is derived in COMBINED DAMAGE, not percentiles:
// Python pushes the two axis ends plus pre_avg / proj_avg and this file does the arithmetic.
//
// THE LOOK IS FINISHED AND NOT NEGOTIABLE: MoEProgress.css was settled in a browser tuner
// (tools/dev/gen_bar_tuner.ps1) and copied verbatim, and this file is a port of that tuner's own
// preview script (setPos / showVal / replay / the animationend force-settle) -- not an
// invention. Its comments explain every value; read them before changing a number. The battle
// window has NO hot-reload (it pins its resources at client launch), so every tweak here costs a
// full client relaunch: tune in the browser, not in the client.
//
// TWO ORIENTATIONS, ONE DOCUMENT. The bar draws HORIZONTALLY (MoEProgress.css, .mp-*) or VERTICALLY
// beside the minimap (MoEProgressVertical.css, .mpv-*) depending on mod_settings'
// progress_bar_orientation, pushed as the VM's `vertical`. Both stylesheets are <link>ed from
// MoEProgressView.html and are namespace-DISJOINT; the choice is a MOUNT-TIME branch (goVertical),
// NOT a second res_map layout -- a new itemID would cost every user a one-time client restart. The
// PLACEMENT half is Python's and already orientation-aware (bridge/bar_window._resolve).
//
// pointer-events:none throughout (in the CSS) -- pure HUD info, never an input target.
import { ModelObserver } from "../../libs/model.js";
// The transient machinery -- arming, the negative-delay debounce, the Alt peek's pause/seek, the end
// race and the surface re-assert -- is SHARED with MoEEfficiency.js. Every behaviour in there cost a

// documents, so this module is instantiated twice with no cross-talk.

// --- the surface, and the rigid shift into it ----------------------------------------------
// A Gameface view PUSHES its own size to C++ through the `viewEnv` global
// (viewEnv.resizeViewRem(w, h), rem == logical px); a view that never calls it gets the engine's
// "default view size" fallback after a `Size calculation timeout` -- a flat 256x256 logical px,
// which is what clipped this bar. WG precedent for the same window shape: DogTagMarkerView.js
// calls resize(500, 300, "rem") once on mount, and ~85 WG views do the same. There is NO
// Python-side and NO res_map lever for this (see bridge/bar_window.py).
//
// BUT THE ENGINE ALSO TRIES TO MEASURE THE DOCUMENT, AND ITS FALLBACK RUNS LAST AND WINS. Pushing
// the size is not sufficient on its own: our resize landed at 04.8s, the size-calculation deadline
// expired at 06.2s and its action ("Set the default view size") overwrote our pushed size with the
// 256x256 default. The static, in-flow #moe-bar-box (MoEProgressView.html, sized in
// MoEProgress.css to exactly the derived surface -- keep it in lockstep with the BOX_*/PAD_REM
// below) was meant to make the document measurable and stop the timeout. RE-MEASURED LIVE: IT DOES
// NOT. The box is there, in-flow and correctly sized, and the timeout fires anyway. So the shared
// module's SURFACE_REASSERT_MS is not a belt-and-braces guard -- it is the ONLY fix, and the window
// before it is the one T.settled() hides the bar through.
//
// The composition's MEASURED bounding box, document origin at (0,0) and 1rem == 1 logical px, is
// 360 x 72 -- .mp-backdrop IS the extremes (left -80rem / top -34rem / 360 wide / 72 tall,
// MoEProgress.css) and every caption, tick and glow sits inside it. So the surface is that box
// plus PAD_REM of slack on all four sides (the text-/box-shadow bleed reaches the box edge
// exactly), and the whole composition is rigidly translated by that much so NOTHING sits at a
// negative coordinate -- an origin overflow is clipped no matter how big the surface is.
//
// THE SIDE CLEARANCE IS 80rem AND IT IS NOT WIDTH-DERIVED: the box is the 200rem track (see
// #moe-bar-root's width note in the CSS) plus BOX_LEFT_REM on each side, so a track resize moves
// BOX_W_REM by exactly the same amount and every per-side margin is preserved.
// WHICH CAPTION IS THE EXTREME HAS NOW MOVED THREE TIMES, so all three extremes are RE-DERIVED here
// from the shipped CSS and MoEBattle.ttf's own advances (digit 0.4932em, comma 0.2471, paren 0.3008,
// plus 0.4932; 1rem == 1 logical px; every figure re-checked against the ttf's hmtx). The two moves
// in THIS revision: the .mp-capL axis-floor caption is GONE outright, and the REMAINING-BATTLES
// COUNT moved OFF the delta and ONTO .mp-capR with a glyph of its own.
//   RIGHT -- .mp-capR, and it is now the extreme by a wide margin. ONE flex row, FOUR items --
//   plus a FIFTH term now, the ETA GAP (.mp-ico.battles's own margin-left, DOM order after the
//   requirement numeral and before the battles glyph -- it widens the row, not a box of its own):
//     3.00 (.mp-cap.side.mp-capR's margin-left off the track end)
//     + 17.00 (.mp-ico.mk / .mp-ico.moe) + 1.00 (.mp-cap .mp-ico's shared gap)
//     + 31.08 ("3,050", a 4-digit requirement, at the .side 14rem: 4*6.9048 + 3.4594)
//     + 4.00 (.mp-ico.battles's margin-left -- the ETA GAP, added to breathe the requirement
//       numeral apart from the remaining-battles count that follows it)
//     + 13.00 (.mp-ico.battles -- it takes .mp-ico's BASE box, the only glyph in the file that does)
//     + 1.00 (that same shared gap) + 13.81 ("99", the PROGRESS_ETA_CAP ceiling, 2*6.9048 at 14rem)
//     == 83.89rem of BOXES, + 1.00 for the numerals' dark-drop text-shadow radius == 84.89rem.
//     SO IT OVERHANGS THE 80rem BACKDROP CLEARANCE BY 4.89rem (UP FROM 0.89rem BEFORE THE GAP) --
//     and unlike before, that overhang is NO LONGER pure shadow halo. The final "99" numeral's own
//     box now spans 70.08 -> 83.89rem, i.e. 3.89rem of ITS BOX (not just its shadow) sits PAST the
//     80rem backdrop edge, on bare HUD. At the .side 14rem size one digit is 6.9048rem wide, so
//     3.89rem is a bit over half a digit -- WORST CASE IS ROUGHLY THE OUTER HALF OF THE LAST DIGIT
//     LOSING ITS DARK BACKING, and it only reaches that worst case when a 4-digit requirement
//     ("3,050"-shaped) and a 2-digit ETA ("99") land together. THIS IS A KNOWN, ACCEPTED TRADEOFF
//     OF THE 4rem GAP, not a bug to chase: do NOT fix it by moving the backdrop, changing
//     PROGRESS_ANCHOR_X_OFFSET, shrinking this gap, or re-deriving it away -- that is the
//     maintainer's call, not this file's.
//     DISTINGUISH OVERHANG FROM CLIPPING before reaching for the geometry -- the surface is a
//     further PAD_REM out at 90rem, so CLIPPING STARTS AT 90 and there is still 5.11rem of
//     clearance before that (90 - 84.89): nothing here is clipped, only unbacked.
//     REBALANCING THE BACKDROP IS NOT FREE AND WAS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE. Taking clearance off the
//     now-empty left side (80/80 -> e.g. 52/108, keeping BOX_W_REM and so the surface AND the mouse
//     hit rect) breaks the symmetry that lets positioning.anchor_centred's `max_x // 2` centre the
//     bar with NO X term in Python: constants.PROGRESS_ANCHOR_X_OFFSET is 0, and
//     tests/test_progress_surface_mirror.py::test_the_large_backdrop_stays_symmetric_about_the_track
//     pins exactly that. Any asymmetry slides the bar half the error sideways at every resolution
//     until that constant -- plus a Large twin for it, since it is logical px and the block's
//     x-lengths carry SIZE_XF -- follows. That is a positioning change, not a CSS one.
//   CENTRE (.mp-capC) RIGHT -- back down, now that the "/NN" suffix is off the delta:
//     17.76 (half of "3,050" at the .dn 16rem == 35.52) + 4.20 (.mp-d's 0.35em gap of its OWN 12rem
//     font) + 30.89 ("(+297)" at 12rem) + 6.00 (.mp-d-num's sign-glow text-shadow radius)
//     == 58.85rem, i.e. 21.15rem SPARE. That reproduces the pre-count figure exactly, as it must.
//     A 4-digit delta ("(+2,970)" == 39.78) still only reaches 67.74rem, and needs cd ~ 150,000.
//   LEFT -- .mp-capC at 0% is the ONLY candidate left, and its ICON path beats its numeral's glow:
//     17.76 (the same half-numeral) + 17.00 (.mp-capC .mp-ico's negative-margin overhang)
//     + 0.48 (that icon's ::before glow, 3% of its 16rem box) == 35.24rem, against the numeral's
//     own 17.76 + 6.00 == 23.76. So 35.24rem and 44.76rem SPARE: ~45rem of dead space out there.
//     (An earlier revision of this note SUMMED those two paths into 41.24rem. They are
//     ALTERNATIVES, not terms -- the 6rem is the numeral's own text-shadow and stops at -23.76.)
//   The .mp-full case is UNCHANGED and now provably so: battles_to_axis_hi returns 0 exactly when
//   proj_avg >= axis_hi, which is the same test .mp-full toggles on, so the count is suppressed on
//   every gold frame and needs no `#moe-bar-root.mp-full .mp-eta` rule of its own.
//   Large is NOT size-mode-agnostic (it needs its own sum, the x-length terms scale by SIZE_XF while
//   the boxes/numerals scale via the root font alone) but is still strictly slacker: the clearance
//   grows 80 -> 106.667rem, and the ETA GAP's own Large twin (.mp-ico.battles's margin-left, an
//   x-length like the shared gaps: 4 * 4/3 == 5.333) is the only new term --
//   capR' == 4 + 17 + 1.333 + 31.08 + 5.333 + 13 + 1.333 + 13.81 + 1 == 87.89rem, 18.78rem spare
//   (down from 24.1rem before the gap, since the gap only widens the reach and the backdrop grows
//   for a different reason). Still comfortably unclipped, so the Default size keeps binding on
//   every side.
// Keep the 80rem, and re-derive ALL THREE extremes again before ever moving it -- "which one is the
// extreme" has now moved three times, and each move invalidated the previous revision's spare.
// These five ARE this bar's surface contract and stay HERE, per bar. MoEBarTransient derives the
// rest from them (its box*/pad arguments), exactly as this file used to:
//   VIEW_W_REM = BOX_W_REM + 2 * PAD_REM == 380     SHIFT_X_REM = PAD_REM - BOX_LEFT_REM == 90
//   VIEW_H_REM = BOX_H_REM + 2 * PAD_REM == 92      SHIFT_Y_REM = PAD_REM - BOX_TOP_REM  == 44
// SHIFT_Y_REM is MIRRORED (negated) in Python as
// domain/constants.PROGRESS_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT, so changing BOX_TOP_REM or PAD_REM moves the bar on
// screen until that constant follows -- and #moe-bar-box in MoEProgress.css is sized to the derived
// surface, a THIRD copy: keep all three in lockstep. The hit padding and the re-assert timing live
// in the shared module (its HIT_MAGIC / SURFACE_REASSERT_MS -- both LOAD-BEARING, read its header).
const BOX_LEFT_REM = -80;                            // .mp-backdrop's left  == leftmost edge
const BOX_TOP_REM = -34;                             // .mp-backdrop's top   == topmost edge
const BOX_W_REM = 360;                               // .mp-backdrop's width
const BOX_H_REM = 72;                                // .mp-backdrop's height
const PAD_REM = 10;

// --- THE VERTICAL ORIENTATION (mod_settings.progress_bar_orientation, pushed as the VM's
// `vertical`) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A SECOND COMPOSITION IN THE SAME DOCUMENT, not a restyle of this one: its own stylesheet
// (MoEProgressVertical.css, <link>ed alongside MoEProgress.css from MoEProgressView.html), its own
// namespace-disjoint class prefix (.mpv-*), its own DOM order (numeral BEFORE icon) and its own
// surface. NO second res_map entry and NO second BarHost: orientation is a MOUNT-TIME branch, and a
// new itemID would cost every user a one-time client restart.
//
// V_BOX_* IS .mpv-backdrop, exactly as BOX_* above is .mp-backdrop -- and it is the axis-swap of it
// with the tuner's own tuned lengths, NOT a transpose of these four (46 wide against 360 tall, vs
// 360 x 72; the side clearance is 34 a side, not 80, because a vertical bar's captions grow along
// its cross axis and the tuned overhang differs, and the RIGHT edge is trimmed -- see V_BOX_W_REM's
// own note below). PAD_REM serves the Y axis; the X axis is a SPLIT pad, V_PAD_X_REM on the left
// (caption ink) and V_PAD_XR_REM on the right (the track's own tick overhang, deliberately smaller
// -- see both constants' own notes below), so:
//   V_VIEW_W_REM = V_BOX_W_REM                   V_SHIFT_X_REM = V_PAD_X_REM - V_BOX_LEFT_REM == 104
//               + V_PAD_X_REM + V_PAD_XR_REM == 112
//   V_VIEW_H_REM = V_BOX_H_REM + 2 * PAD_REM
//                                - V_CLIP_B_REM == 320 V_SHIFT_Y_REM = PAD_REM - V_BOX_TOP_REM  == 90
// V_SHIFT_Y_REM is MIRRORED (negated) in Python as domain/constants.VERTICAL_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT (-90,
// and -113 for Large == -round(90 * SIZE_F)), which is SHARED with the Damage Efficiency bar --
// unlike the horizontal pair's 44-vs-50 split, both vertical compositions have the identical
// backdrop top and height. #moe-bar-box in MoEProgressVertical.css is sized to the derived surface,
// a THIRD copy: keep all three in lockstep.
//
// THE SURFACE IS THE ONLY SIDE THAT IS NOT box + PAD_REM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (V_CLIP_B_REM).
// The engine clamps EVERY window into [0, space - surface] in compiled C++ (movePyWindow -- memory
// `engine-clamps-every-wulf-window-to-screen-and-the-mod-depends-on-it`; bar_window._extent's
// far-sentinel calibration DEPENDS on that clamp existing), so the surface's bottom edge can never go
// below the screen's, and a bar anchored to the minimap therefore lands however far its TRACK sits
// above its own surface bottom -- never closer. At a full box + PAD_REM surface that was
// 380 - 290 == 90 logical px, against the vertical tuner's tuned `mmGapBottom` of 30
// (tools/dev/gen_bar_tuner_vertical.ps1:451), i.e. the tuned look was unreachable by ~60px and
// domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_GAP_BOTTOM could not be honoured at all.
// THE SURFACE DOES NOT HAVE TO CONTAIN THE BACKDROP -- only the caption INK. The tuner's stage clips
// the backdrop's lower bleed at exactly this gap and that IS the approved appearance, so the surface
// is shortened to the tuned gap and the bleed clips at its bottom edge:
//   V_CLIP_B_REM == (V_BOX_H_REM + 2*PAD_REM) - (V_SHIFT_Y_REM + barLen + mmGapBottom)
//                == 380 - (90 + 200 + 30) == 60
// and the surface's below-the-track slack becomes 320 - 290 == 30 == the tuned gap exactly (290 is
// V_SHIFT_Y_REM + barLen == domain/constants.MM_TRACK_Y, which this does NOT move -- see below).
// WHAT IT COSTS, DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED CSS, is 3rem of clearance on the bottom caption's ink and
// nothing else. .mpv-capC (MoEProgressVertical.css) is `top: 100%` + `margin-top: 6rem` off the
// track's bottom end, its flex row is `line-height: 20.5rem` tall (the tallest of its three children:
// the 20.5 numeral line box beats the 16rem .dmgc icon and the 15.5rem delta), so its box ends
// 6 + 20.5 == 26.5rem below the track; the numeral's own translateY(-0.5rem) plus its 1rem dark-drop
// text-shadow radius reaches 27.0, the delta's translateY(1.5rem) + the same 1rem reaches 25.5, and
// the icon's translate(0, 1rem) + its ::before 106% glow (3% of 16rem) reaches 26.2. So the deepest
// ink is 27.0 against 30 of slack. The ONLY thing past the edge is the sign-glow's soft tail (the
// 6rem blur on .mpv-d-num / .mpv-v in the up/down states, reaching ~32.5) -- which the tuner clips
// at its stage bottom too, at the same 30, which is what the maintainer approved.
// IT MOVES NOTHING ELSE, BY CONSTRUCTION: the clip is applied to the SURFACE only and never to
// shiftY, so the composition sits exactly where it did inside the surface and BOTH mirrored Python
// constants -- VERTICAL_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT (-90) and MM_TRACK_Y (290) -- are unchanged. Nothing reflows
// either: every length in the two vertical stylesheets is a rem or a % of a rem-sized ancestor (the
// only viewport-relative rule in either document is `body { margin: 0 }`), so a shorter surface can
// only clip, never re-lay-out.
// UNDER LARGE the clip is inside applySize's `* f`, so the slack is 400 - 363 == 37 logical px while
// PROGRESS_MM_GAP_BOTTOM stays a fixed 30: the gap is then UNREACHABLE and the engine flushes the
// surface to the screen bottom, which lands the track at 30 * SIZE_F == 37.5 -> 37. That is the
// tuned gap SCALED, i.e. the same look 1.25x, which is exactly right -- do NOT "fix" it with a
// MM_GAP_BOTTOM_LARGE twin, and do NOT take the clip out of the `* f` to force reachability: a
// fixed-px clip would keep biting the same 60rem out of a composition whose ink grew 1.25x, and the
// bottom caption would start clipping for real.
// THE 256x256 SIZE-TIMEOUT FALLBACK STILL RUNS LAST AND STILL WINS on this path -- the vertical
// surface is pushed and RE-ASSERTED after the deadline by exactly the same shared machinery
// (MoEBarTransient's SURFACE_REASSERT_MS), and each push round-trips back to Python as
// onSizeChanged -> bar_window._place, which is what makes the placement agree with the surface.
//
// ...AND THE X AXIS IS NOT box + PAD_REM EITHER (V_PAD_X_REM). The three captions are
// RIGHT-ANCHORED and grow LEFTWARD from a fixed edge (`right: 100%; left: auto`,
// MoEProgressVertical.css's .mpv-cap), so their ink runs well past .mpv-backdrop's left edge --
// and unlike the horizontal bar, THE BACKDROP IS NOT MEANT TO COVER THEM (maintainer's call: the
// look is settled, the backdrop stays exactly where the tuner put it). At the shipped
// PAD_REM the surface's left edge sat at -44rem and CUT TWO OF THE THREE ROWS. So the X slack is
// decoupled from the backdrop rect: V_PAD_X_REM widens the SURFACE alone, .mpv-backdrop's
// `left: -34rem; width: 72rem` is untouched, and nothing on screen moves but the clip.
//
// IT IS APPLIED TO BOTH SIDES EVEN THOUGH ONLY THE LEFT NEEDS IT, and that is the load-bearing
// half. Only the LEFT reach is a real requirement -- the right side has ~48rem of dead space at
// PAD_REM already -- but a LEFT-ONLY pad makes the surface asymmetric about the track, and the
// centred (Damage Log) alignment is `max_x // 2` with NO x term in Python
// (positioning.anchor_centred_reduced), i.e. it centres the SURFACE and only centres the BAR while
// the two are concentric. Left-only would have slid that alignment 26 logical px right at Default
// and 33 at Large -- a visible move, for a fix whose whole brief was "nothing on screen may look
// different except that the caption text is no longer cut off". Symmetric costs 53rem of surface
// on a side nobody looks at and is FREE: the surface rect is never drawn, the mouse hit rect is
// collapsed PER AXIS (MoEBarTransient's pushHitArea pads X by half the surface WIDTH and Y by half
// the surface HEIGHT), so widening padX only grows the X pad by exactly the same amount it grows
// viewW by -- the X axis still collapses to zero width either way, and the Y axis (which this
// widening never touches) is untouched. The input rect does not move. Do NOT "reclaim" the right
// side.
// THE WORST-CASE REACH, RE-DERIVED for the row split with Job 2's icon BOXES reverted (maintainer:
// "icon sizes must stay the same, adjust paddings individually" -- dmgp/mk/moe are back at their
// pre-039a58c 14/17/17rem, only per-icon margin-left differs from the shared 1rem now; see
// MoEProgressVertical.css's own notes), from the shipped CSS and MoEBattle.ttf's own advances
// (digit 0.4932em, comma 0.2471, paren 0.3008, sign 0.4932 -- the same figures the horizontal
// extremes above use). Each row's ink starts at `-padding-right + translateX` off the track's left
// edge and grows leftward; the design is digit-count INVARIANT at the anchor (see the CSS's own
// note), so a static worst case is sound:
//   .mpv-capC (bottom) IS STILL THE EXTREME, and MORE so now: the maintainer's own "move the
//     bottom block left 7px" nudge shrank its translateX from 16 to 9, moving the anchor 7rem
//     CLOSER to the surface's left edge (mind the clip -- every one of these captions is
//     right-anchored, so "left" is the OVERFLOW direction). .mpv-ico.dmgc still keeps its base
//     1rem margin ("the reference"), and this is still budgeted for the 4-DIGIT delta case, not
//     the 3-digit one:
//     (-6 + 9) - [ 39.78 ("(+2,970)" at the .mpv-d 12rem) + 4.20 (its 0.35em gap of that same
//     12rem) + 35.52 ("3,050" at 16rem) + 1.00 (the shared icon gap) + 16.00 (.mpv-ico.dmgc) ]
//     - 6.00 (.mpv-d-num's up/down sign GLOW, the widest text-shadow in the file) == -99.49rem
//     (was -92.49 before the nudge -- exactly +7, the same device-px count the translateX lost).
//     A 3-digit delta ("(+297)" == 30.89) reaches only -90.61.
//   .mpv-capR (now JUST the requirement group -- the eta group moved to its own row below): the
//     mark icon's own margin correction (-1.25rem) makes IT the shorter reach; the icon that
//     actually binds is .moe (the achievement glyph that REPLACES .mk once 3 marks are earned),
//     whose margin correction (+0.885rem) is now the LARGER combined offset -- the two are no
//     longer interchangeable the way they were pre-039a58c (same box, same shared margin, same
//     18-total either way):
//     mk:  (-6 + 14) - [ 31.08 ("3,050" at 14rem) + (-1.25) + 17 (.mpv-ico.mk) ] - 1.00 == -39.83
//     moe: (-6 + 14) - [ 31.08 + 0.885 + 17 (.mpv-ico.moe) ] - 1.00 == -41.97rem (the WORSE case)
//   .mpv-capEta (stacked above capR): (-6 + 14) - [ 13.81 ("99" at 14rem, the PROGRESS_ETA_CAP
//     ceiling) + 1.038 (.mpv-ico.battles's own margin correction, not the shared 1rem) + 13
//     (.mpv-ico's base box, the battles glyph) ] - 1.00 == -20.85rem -- still the SLACKEST row in
//     the file by a wide margin.
//   .mpv-capP (moving, dmgp back at 14rem, margin corrected to 1.253rem): (-6 + 0) -
//     [ 31.08 + 1.253 + 14 (.mpv-ico.dmgp) ] - 1.00 == -53.33rem.
// capC is STILL the extreme (99.49 > 53.33 > 41.97 > 20.85), and the maintainer's own 7px-left
// nudge ate the margin (104 - 99.49 == 4.51, was 97 - 92.49 == 4.51 before -- the SAME margin,
// because V_PAD_X_REM grew by the identical +7): the surface's left edge had to move WITH it:
//   V_PAD_X_REM == 104 + V_BOX_LEFT_REM == 104 - 34 == 70   (was 63; +7, matching the capC nudge)
// GROWING THIS MOVES THE TRACK INSIDE THE SURFACE, so domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X(
// _LARGE) had to grow with it by the exact same amount (in logical px, i.e. *SIZE_F under Large)
// or the visible bar would slide RIGHT into the minimap -- see that constant's own comment.
// tests/test_progress_surface_mirror.py::test_the_vertical_captions_fit_inside_the_surface is the
// GATE on all of the above -- it re-derives every row from the stylesheet and the advances rather
// than trusting this note, and goes red the moment V_PAD_X_REM is trimmed. Splitting capR into
// capR + capEta means the test's `rows` dict owes a matching split, or it silently keeps checking
// the STALE (pre-split) shape and goes green over a layout it no longer describes.
//
// THE Y-AXIS FIT FOR THE NEW STACKED ROW (Job 1's own re-derivation obligation -- the maintainer's
// estimate of "~56rem of headroom" was explicitly flagged as unverified and is checked here
// instead of trusted). Measuring DOWN from the track's own top edge (y=0, the same origin
// V_BOX_TOP_REM uses): .mpv-capR's own box reaches capR's padding-bottom(6) + line-height(18) ==
// 24rem above the track top. .mpv-capEta stacks on top of THAT via its own
// `padding-bottom: 30rem` (== capR's 24rem box + a 6rem visual gap, the same magnitude this file
// already uses to clear the track), so capEta's box reaches 30 + 18(its own line-height) == 48rem
// above the track top. Add the row's own translateY nudge (-0.5rem, capEta's numeral) and the
// widest text-shadow in the file (the up/down sign glow, 6rem) for the worst-case ink, exactly as
// the X-fit test's own `halo` term does: 48 + 0.5 + 6 == 54.5rem.
// THE SURFACE'S OWN TOP CLEARANCE is -V_BOX_TOP_REM + PAD_REM == 80 + 10 == 90rem (the backdrop's
// own top bleed plus the uniform Y pad -- V_CLIP_B_REM only shortens the BOTTOM, never the top).
// 90 - 54.5 == 35.5rem of spare: the new row fits comfortably inside the EXISTING backdrop/surface
// with room to spare, so NEITHER V_BOX_TOP_REM/V_BOX_H_REM NOR VERTICAL_ANCHOR_Y_SHIFT (shared with
// the vertical Damage Efficiency bar) had to move for this change -- exactly what Job 1 asked to
// confirm before touching either. tests/test_progress_surface_mirror.py carries the matching gate,
// re-deriving both sides from source rather than hardcoding 54.5 and 90 as two literals that would
// have to agree by hand.
// LARGE IS STRICTLY SLACKER and needs no twin: the allowance is `V_PAD_X_REM - V_BOX_LEFT_REM*4/3`
// == 115.33rem (was 108.33 before V_PAD_X_REM grew to 70 -- the backdrop's left bleed is an
// x-length and takes SIZE_XF; V_PAD_X_REM, like PAD_REM, does NOT -- the ink it covers is
// rem-sized and rides the root font's SIZE_F alone), while the ink only grows on its three
// x-GAPS. The Default size keeps binding.
// THE MINIMAP ANCHOR MUST FOLLOW THIS CONSTANT. domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X's PURE
// derivation is `V_SHIFT_X_REM + trackW`, i.e. where the track sits inside the surface -- widen
// the left slack without growing it and the whole bar slides left by the difference. The shipped
// constant also carries a further -2 measured hand-placement correction on top; see its
// derivation there.
//
// FOUR DURABLE FACTS, established by reading the source rather than assuming (a maintainer once
// saw the minimap's first column "covered by a dark panel" and the fix took four rounds to land):
//   1. THE BACKDROP IS NOT MEANT TO COVER THE RIGHT-ANCHORED CAPTIONS -- only V_PAD_X_REM (above)
//      was ever sized for their ink. .mpv-backdrop is a SEPARATE rectangle, drawn for the
//      shadow/glow bleed around the TRACK, and every one of capR/capEta/capP/capC already reaches
//      far past it by design (see the worst-case reach note above -- 20.85 to 99.49rem, against a
//      34rem backdrop bleed). Do not "fix" a clip by widening the backdrop; that is V_PAD_X_REM's
//      job, on the SURFACE, which is never drawn.
//   2. THE VERTICAL BAR'S BACKDROP HAS NO SYMMETRY CONTRACT. `test_the_large_backdrop_stays_
//      symmetric_about_the_track` (tests/test_progress_surface_mirror.py) asserts symmetry ONLY
//      for the HORIZONTAL bar's `.mp-backdrop`, because `anchor_centred_reduced`'s `max_x // 2` has
//      no X term and only centres the BAR by centring the SURFACE -- true for the Damage Log
//      (horizontal) anchor. Fixed+Vertical resolves through `anchor_minimap` instead
//      (bar_window._resolve), whose `x = space_x - mm_size - gap - overhang - edge_x` reads
//      `edge_x` (PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X) and NOTHING about the backdrop's own width or left. Trimming
//      `.mpv-backdrop` asymmetrically (this file's own V_BOX_W_REM, leaving V_BOX_LEFT_REM alone)
//      moves nothing the placement math depends on.
//   3. THE BACKDROP TRIM (V_BOX_W_REM 72 -> 46) WAS REAL WORK -- KEEP IT. A maintainer report of
//      the backdrop "sitting well clear of the minimap" turned out to describe a DIFFERENT panel;
//      measured live (window pos (1294,760), minimap index 4 == 510px wide at 1920x1080 logical
//      space), THIS backdrop's own right edge (V_PAD_X_REM + V_BOX_W_REM == 70+46==116) landed
//      EXACTLY on the minimap's own left edge (PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X + MM_GAP + MM_TICK_OVERHANG ==
//      105+8+3==116) -- zero overlap, by design, at the tuned 46, AT THE TIME (the shared MM_GAP
//      was 8). Reverting to 72 (right edge 142) would reopen a real 26rem overlap. Do not touch
//      V_BOX_W_REM again without a live measurement to justify it.
//      SINCE THEN, PLACEMENT MOVED CLOSER TO THE MINIMAP (domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_GAP(_LARGE),
//      5/6, replacing the shared MM_GAP(8) for this bar's own anchor) -- the backdrop's own DRAWN
//      right edge no longer sits flush with the minimap's own (now closer) left edge, it is a few
//      rem PAST it. That is not a regression: fact 4 below already established the DRAWN backdrop
//      is not what clears the minimap, the invisible SURFACE is (V_PAD_XR_REM/_LARGE), and the
//      surface still clears it with a real, checked margin at the new gap -- see V_PAD_XR_REM's own
//      derivation below for the current numbers.
//   4. THE ACTUAL CULPRIT WAS THE INVISIBLE SURFACE'S OWN RIGHT PAD, NEVER UPDATED TO MATCH. The
//      backdrop trim shrank the DRAWN rect; nothing shrank the SURFACE (the mouse-hit-blocking rect
//      per this file's header) on that side, so it stayed the OLD symmetric V_PAD_X_REM(70) past
//      the ALREADY-TRIMMED backdrop -- measured live: window size (186,320) == 46+70+70, its right
//      edge 70 logical px INSIDE the minimap (space_x - mm_size == 1410; window right == 1294+186==
//      1480). See MoEBarTransient.js's `padXR`/`padXRLarge` arg notes for the fix (a SEPARATE,
//      smaller right pad, V_PAD_XR_REM/_LARGE below) and V_PAD_XR_REM's own derivation. Because the
//      fix only shrinks the RIGHT pad and V_PAD_X_REM (the LEFT side, where the caption ink and the
//      track itself both live) is untouched, `shiftX` and therefore PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X(_LARGE) --
//      both pure functions of the LEFT side alone -- need no correction, and the bar does not move
//      on screen (confirmed live: the measured window position matches anchor_minimap bit-exactly
//      already, before this pad fix, and stays that way after it).
//   5. PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X CARRIES A -2 HAND CORRECTION (see its own derivation in domain/
//      constants.py) THAT MUST NOT LEAK INTO THIS FILE'S OWN SURFACE-WIDTH MATH. That correction
//      exists ONLY to match a measured discrepancy in where the WINDOW lands in SPACE (two
//      independent Ctrl-drags); it shifts the whole window (surface + everything drawn inside it)
//      by a constant 2px, and does NOT change where the TICK renders inside its OWN surface -- that
//      is a pure JS/CSS fact (shiftX + trackW), unrelated to any Python-side placement fudge. Using
//      the CORRECTED constant (105) as if it were this bar's own local tick position (as an earlier
//      pass of this fix did) UNDERSTATES the tick's real reach by exactly that 2px and clips it --
//      the true local tick-right is shiftX(104) + trackW(3) + MM_TICK_OVERHANG(3) == 110, not 108.
//      See V_PAD_XR_REM's own derivation below, which uses the PURE (uncorrected) value throughout.

// knob from the backdrop's own V_BOX_W_REM trim above: the backdrop trim shrinks what is DRAWN, this
// shrinks what is CLICK-BLOCKING (the surface, never drawn). Shrunk close to the minimum the TRACK's
// own ink needs on that side: the tick's cross-axis overhang past its own edge
// (domain/constants.MM_TICK_OVERHANG(_LARGE), the SAME term anchor_minimap's `x` formula already
// adds as clearance), plus a small, deliberate MARGIN (+2 logical/document px, flat, NOT xf-scaled
// -- see fact 5: this is a JS-local geometry decision, so it uses the PURE tick position, never
// PROGRESS_MM_TRACK_X's hand-corrected placement value) so the surface's own edge is never flush
// with the tick's -- a flush boundary is exactly the "rounding could shave a px and eat the ink"
// risk fact 5 exists to head off. Nothing for caption ink is needed on this side at all -- every
// caption here is anchored to the LEFT (see V_PAD_X_REM's own note), so the right side backs nothing
// but the (already-trimmed) backdrop's own remaining decorative bleed, which this pad now clips a
// little further, at the surface edge, rather than containing it (the same clip-not-contain pattern
// V_CLIP_B_REM already uses on the bottom).
// Solved directly against MoEBarTransient.applySize's own formula
// (viewW == round((boxW*xf + padX + padXR) * f)), using the PURE (uncorrected) tick position:
//   tick-right (Default, xf=f=1) == shiftX(104) + trackW(3) + MM_TICK_OVERHANG(3) == 110
//   Default:  viewW == 110 + 2 (margin) == 112  ->  padXR == 112 - V_BOX_W_REM(46) - V_PAD_X_REM(70) == -4
//   tick-right (Large, PRE-SIZE_F) == shiftX_pre_f(346/3) + trackW_large(4) + overhang_large_pre_f(4)
//                                  == 370/3 ~= 123.333 (renders at 123.333*SIZE_F ~= 154.167 device px)
//   Large:    viewW_pre_f == 370/3 + 2 == 376/3 ~= 125.333  ->  round(125.333 * SIZE_F) == 157
//     padXRLarge == 376/3 - boxW*xf(184/3) - V_PAD_X_REM(70) == -18/3 == -6 (exact)
// Both NEGATIVE: the surface's right edge sits a LITTLE further inside the backdrop's own (already
// trimmed) drawn rect than its own edge -- the box+left-pad sum (46+70==116 Default, 61.333+70==
// 131.333 pre-SIZE_F Large) was flush with the minimap at the ORIGINAL shared MM_GAP(8) (fact 3),
// so ANY margin (to the tick, or to the minimap) needed the surface a shade smaller still. This
// derivation (padXR/padXRLarge themselves) is UNCHANGED by the later gap move -- it is pure
// JS/CSS geometry, independent of where Python decides to place the window -- but the MARGIN it
// buys against the minimap moved WITH that gap. Resulting margins, both real and checked
// (tests/test_progress_surface_mirror.py::test_the_surface_clears_the_minimap_at_every_size_index
// / test_the_surface_does_not_clip_the_tick), at domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_GAP(_LARGE) == 5/6:
// Default clears the minimap by 1px (was 4px at the original shared gap of 8) and the tick by
// 2px; Large by 1px (was 3px) and ~2.8px respectively -- none of it flush, none of it negative.
// padXRLarge is NOT padXR*SIZE_XF, for the same reason MM_TRACK_X_LARGE and MM_TICK_OVERHANG_LARGE
// are their own literals: the Large geometry (trackW_large, shiftX_large) is not a pure *SIZE_XF
// scale of the Default one once V_BOX_LEFT_REM's own fractional Large scaling is folded in, so
// neither is what clears it -- see the derivation above, computed directly, not scaled.
// GROWN (2026-08-10, in-client review) so the surface still reaches the minimap's 1px floor after
// the placement gap was RESTORED to 8 (domain/constants.PROGRESS_MM_GAP(_LARGE)). Solved directly
// against anchor_minimap's margin (== gap + overhang + edge_x - view_w). ADVANCED 4 logical px into
// the minimap (2026-08-12, in-client): the previous margin==1 cleared the minimap's DROP-SHADOW by
// 1px but left the backdrop 4px off the minimap's REAL visible edge -- the maintainer confirmed that
// 4px is the minimap's non-interactive frame margin and is safe to consume (the Ctrl-click area is
// further in). So the surface's right edge (and the flush strips) now sit at margin == -3 (3px into
// that frame margin), flush against the minimap itself:
//   Default: view_w == 8 + 3 + 105 - (-3) == 119 -> padXR == 119 - V_BOX_W(46) - V_PAD_X(70) == 3
//   Large:   view_w == 8 + 5 + 147 - (-3) == 163 -> padXRLarge == 163/SIZE_F - boxW*xf(61.333) - 70
//                                             == 130.4 - 131.333 == -0.933

// grew, which moves the surface's minimap-facing edge alone, not the track.

// ...and THE VERTICAL COMPOSITION'S markup, the tuner's own stage verbatim
// (tools/dev/gen_bar_tuner_vertical.ps1). FOUR structural differences from the horizontal template
// above, all of them the tuner's tuned layout and none of them free to "tidy":
//   * NUMERAL BEFORE ICON in every caption (the icon trails, away from the track). That is what
//     makes the shared right:100% anchor digit-count invariant -- the icon is the LAST in-flow
//     child, flush against a FIXED edge, so only the numeral grows, and leftward. Reversing it
//     re-introduces the exact defect that shipped once on the horizontal bar.
//   * the DELTA is ordered FIRST on capC (delta, numeral, icon), an in-flow flex child with a
//     margin gap -- never an out-of-flow box hanging off a content-dependent edge.
//   * capP lives INSIDE .mpv-track and capR / capC are its SIBLINGS, exactly as the tuner has them
//     (root and track are the same 3x200rem box, so every percentage resolves identically either
//     way; this only keeps the diff against the tuner readable).
//   * the two axis-end ticks are mpv-bottom / mpv-top, not mp-left / mp-right.
// capR is now TWO STACKED ROWS, not one (maintainer's call: "move the ETA on top of the next mark
// requirement"), ported here only -- the tuner's own stage keeps both numeral+icon groups on ONE
// row, untouched (see MoEProgressVertical.css's HAND-EDIT 6/6). `.mpv-capEta` (the eta numeral +
// battles glyph) sits directly ABOVE `.mpv-capR` (now JUST the requirement numeral + mark glyph),
// both anchored by the SAME right:100% mechanism (copied verbatim: same padding-right/transform/
// font-size/line-height) so both stay digit-count invariant independently. Because the mark icon
// is capR's ONLY icon now (no positional ambiguity to guard against any more, but the cache stays
// for the reason below), setIco() below still writes to a CACHED element captured at mount
// (capMkIco) rather than re-selecting a positional first match; capV()/capEtaIco/capEta stay

// state. E.g., when the bar was red and dealt damage moves it into green, it must appear red and
// then turn green after recalculation lands. If it was and will remain red, it must always show
// red." So the sw==false path (the cold damage entry) writes the numeral back to pre_avg and hides
// the delta but DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH .mp-up/.mp-down: whatever the last showVal(true)
// committed stays applied for the whole 600ms entry, and a NEW sign is only claimed once it lands at
// the swap. The was-red-stays-red case therefore shows NO colour change whatever -- which is the
// whole point; an earlier build stripped both classes here and flashed the neutral fill on every
// single cold entry. Holding a class across coldShow's suppress -> reflow -> armRun sequence
// interpolates nothing: .mp-fill transitions width only, .mp-proj / .mp-capC left only, and no
// .mp-up/.mp-down rule declares a transition at all (see the CSS).
//
// sw==true is the ONLY path that ever REMOVES a class, and it has to stay that way -- it is what
// clears the sign when a transition lands on a rounded-zero delta. So the neutral colour is
// reserved for exactly two states: nothing committed yet (the first show of a battle) and a
// rounded-zero delta. Only this bottom caption (plus the fill and the tick it rides) ever takes
