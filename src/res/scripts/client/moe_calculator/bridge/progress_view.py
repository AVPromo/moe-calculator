"""The centre-screen transient MoE progress bar (the "Moving Average" variant) as its own
OpenWG-registered Gameface window.

A thin instantiation of bridge/bar_window.BarHost -- read that module for the whole hosting model
(why a registered window, why WindowLayer.WINDOW, why NOT WINDOW_FULLSCREEN, why the surface size is
a JS push, why each bar needs its OWN singleton and ModDynAccessor). The bar-specific facts are the
five arguments below and nothing else. The module-level functions stay module-level because
battle_bridge (and its tests) treat this module AS the window handle.

PC-only (needs the live client); not imported under pytest without stubs. Python 2.7 runtime.
