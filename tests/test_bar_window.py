"""Engine-free tests for bridge.bar_window.BarHost's Ctrl+drag gesture: `drag(phase)`, which is the
WHOLE reposition channel -- adapter/battle_input reports "start" / "move" / "end" and each move
re-places the window ABSOLUTELY from the live cursor. The window/view hosting itself
(open_window/_place/apply_position) needs the live client and is out of scope -- only the pure-ish
placement math is covered here.

Technique is test_progress_bridge's: stub the game-only imports bar_window pulls in at module
top so it imports under pytest, then drive it against a fake window that records .move() calls
and reports back a `.position` reflecting them (mirroring the real far-sentinel self-calibration:
moving to the FAR corner reveals the movable extent)."""
