"""Engine-free tests for the DAMAGE EFFICIENCY bar's bridge-level invariants.

Two families, neither reachable from the domain tests:

1. `push_efficiency`'s MARSHALLING: it is EfficiencyVM's only producer, and it WRITES no module
   state -- the delta latch that used to live here (`_eff_last_damage` / `_eff_delta`, plus
   `damageDelta` on the VM) now lives in MoEEfficiency.js off successive `damage` pushes, so
   those behaviours belong to tools/dev/check_efficiency_js.js and NOT to pytest. What the push
   does still READ is the one module global `_battle_epoch` -- the per-battle counter that hands
   that JS latch its battle boundary, which it cannot infer. Its bump lives in `_on_mount_refresh`,
   so the epoch tests at the bottom of this file drive the MOUNT, not just the push.

2. "EXACTLY ONE CENTRE-SCREEN BAR AT A TIME". The two bars are radio ALTERNATIVES under the
   single `progress_bar_enabled` master, and `_window_gates()` is the one place that decides it,
   shared by the battle mount and the live settings apply so the rule cannot drift between them.
   It reads `mod_settings.progress_bar_variant()` DIRECTLY (the `_progress_variant()` wrapper is
   gone), so these tests monkeypatch that getter on mod_settings itself.

Technique mirrors tests/test_battle_bridge_prediction.py: install bare stub modules for the game
imports battle_bridge pulls in transitively, then drive the functions directly. The real
EfficiencyVM needs Wulf, so the push writes into a recording fake -- whose accepted setter names
are cross-checked against the real EfficiencyVM class, so a typo'd setter cannot pass silently.
The window WIRING (does the engine actually open it) needs the live client and is out of scope.
