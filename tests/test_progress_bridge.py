"""Engine-free tests for the MOVING AVERAGE bar's push marshalling (`push_progress`).

The sibling test_efficiency_bridge covers the OTHER centre-screen bar; this file is the same seam
for ProgressVM, which had no pytest coverage of its own. `push_progress` is that model's only
producer, so a property declared on one side without the other leaves the JS reading a default
forever -- and, unlike a missing setter, nothing raises: the push wraps its whole transaction in
`except Exception: LOG_CURRENT_EXCEPTION()`, so a desync is SILENT in the client.

Technique is test_efficiency_bridge's: install bare stub modules for the game imports battle_bridge
pulls in transitively, then drive push_progress directly into a recording fake whose accepted setter
names are cross-checked against the real ProgressVM, so a typo'd setter cannot pass silently. The
window WIRING (does the engine actually open it) needs the live client and is out of scope.
